## methodology
ideally, sticks would be reviewed impartially. personally, i have worked with mayflash in designing the F700FLAT layout, but i attempt to remain impartial.

- f101: cheap ass stick that’s not very good except as a p2 loaner if you hate the person you’re loaning it to | ~40 usd
- f300: many people’s first “real stick”, it’s like $50 and good enough. can work on ps5 and xbox. | 60-80 usd
- f300 elite: f300 but with sanwa lever and buttons. | ~100-110 usd
- f500: also a great beginner stock. magnetic plexi and swappable art, solid metal plates for weight, very solid choice. works on ps5 and xbox with a dongle. | 90 usd
- f500 elite: f500 but with sanwa lever and buttons. | 140-150 usd
- f500flat: a vewlix/hitbox arcade layout leverless. otherwise comparable to f500. many options for SOCD. | 90 usd
- f500flat elite: f500 but with sanwa buttons. | 120 usd
- f700: possibly the most interesting mayflash stick. same case as an f500, but with upgraded pcb that has a battery for bluetooth and 2.4ghz usb dongle wireless. works like a licensed arcade controller on xbox one (old) and ps5, including with the 2.4ghz wireless dongle. released q1 2024 (?) | 146 usd (??)
- f700x: same as the f700 but drops ps5 support for xbox series support. | 150 usd
- f700 elite: f700 but with sanwa buttons and lever. one of the most fully featured sticks on the market, but has the case of a $90 stick. | 180 usd
- f700flat: f700 but with a fully custom made 4 directional+11 action button layout. left pinkie button, 2 additional thumb buttons. | 150 usd
- f700flat elite: f700 but with sanwas. | ??? usd. probably 180.
As you can see, many of mayflash's controllers use the same or similar case. they also have a very active customer support.
